“googleDorking,” also known as “Google hacking”, is a technique used by newsrooms, investigative organizations, security auditors as well as tech savvy criminals to query various search engines for information hidden on public websites and vulnerabilities exposed by public servers. Dorking is a way of using search engines to their full capacity to penetrate web-based services to depths that are not necessarily visible at first or vulnerabilities exist on public server by mistake. Even though this phase is less technical than most, its importance should not be overlooked. The more information you are able to collect, the better your chances of success.

Existing problems with dorking tools,

•	If you're dorking in a country with heavy internet surveillance (i.e. any country), it's possible that your searches could be recorded and used against you in the future.
•	With a greater number of search query requests, search engines might ask you to solve captchas to prove you're human.
•	Search engines might block dork tool traffic with identified IP based traffic pattern.
•	Many dorking tools are associated with single search engine and results get restricted. For similar queries different search engines provide different results and those are more versatile.
•	The most common problem is, dorking tools end up with generating and firing thousands of irrelevant queries, which creates unnecessary network load and irrelevant results.

Drishti is one stop solution for all these problems,

•	It can be used as offensive weapon by hackers and defensive shield by organization against their web servers or public domains. 
•	Tool uses python search engines request library and tor browser library to overcome the captcha and network traffic blocking problem. 
•	It works with multiple search engine to increase the breadth of query results.
•	The query generation and searching are deeply customizable that, it can be controlled up to specific domain and run over multiple search engines.
•	The logical operators used wisely to reduce similar request and increase query search results in single go.
•	The main attraction is, the dorking queries get selected, filtered and rebuild based on port (80 or 443) enumeration results, which drastically reduce the irrelevant requests.
